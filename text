Here at Risidio, we’ve already built and launched the very first Bitcoin NFT marketplace in the world on Stacks, collaborating with British contemporary artist, Chemical X.

On May 13, our team launched This is Number One, a curated collection of unique NFT artworks, made in collaboration with renowned cultural icons such as Cara Delevingne, Fatboy Slim and Dave Stewart from the Eurthymics all supporting the charities and environmental causes of their choice in perpetuity.

We are Risidio a 30-strong multi-cultural team, launched at the start of lockdown and comprising developers, designers, artists, musicians and marketers working virtually from all over the world.

As well as building software that powered multi-million dollar single auction events for the likes of GE and Hilco, our team has also launched and grown many of the leading global technology and consumer brands brands like Microsoft, HP, Cisco, as well as being an integral part of one of the most successful brand campaigns of all time -  the “Intel Inside” campaign.

Now we’re working hand in hand with the Stacks community to help many more brands, artists, musicians and filmmakers – both celebrities and non-celebrities – not to mention their fans and causes - realise the myriad opportunities to monetize their work as NFTs using our integrated set of solutions and marketplace.   

 We’ve already raised $300K in grants and are seeking to raise $1 million in seed funding.
